  <h3>Things I have done:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Went on a backpack trip to Spain through Germany and Lyon, solely based on intuition, without money, volunteering along the way.
    <ul>
      <li>
        I have worked in Heuchlingen, where I had a serious knee accident in the <a href="images/BikingGermany.JPG">mountains</a>. I had to practice patience and resilience, I had to recover in silence,
        as that was not the time to give voice to my struggles, I did not want to cause panic in the family.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also worked in Spain, in Salou. I needed money even for the road to get home, but it was very difficult working there since not many people spoke English.
        I was fired once from the job, stepped up my game, and asked to do one more shift after that.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>Followed synchronistic guidance to leave a workplace for nothing, and submit my resume to work in a bakery.</li>
  <br />
  <li>Doing many things for love, and rejecting numerous love offers, until I met with my current girlfriend, <strong><a href="https://hu.linkedin.com/in/imolakutfej">Molly</strong></a>, which we both realized the mysterious coincidence because of
    the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Celestine_Prophecy">Celestine Prophecy</a></strong>.
    We are still living together. Currently I feel called to secure a more structured lifestyle of efficiency and cleanliness, while still keeping in touch with the support of Higher Powers,
    letting their presence known with the angelic number 777, for example. My priorities as defined yesterday:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Work and Skill development
      </li>
      <li>
        Purification of Self with <strong><a href="images\MollysSosei.jpg">Zen meditation</a></strong> with the One Drop Zen Sangha
      </li>
      <li>
        Keeping the Body Strong Enough
      </li>
    </ol>
